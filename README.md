# Important information
Here I've used the **.env** file so I can hide my important information that others shouldn't see (you can do the same). Here I used **sequelize** to connect the database to the project. **Bcrypt** to keep the passwords secure (so that they don't end up in plaintext in the database).**JWT** provides a secure front-end connection. **Cors** makes contact with the front. **Multer** allows you to store images in a database.

- config (for database)
